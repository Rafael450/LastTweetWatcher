# Last Tweet Watcher

A simple program that I created to watch a certain twitter account. It makes an annoying sound every time the account makes a new tweet.

To use it you must:
1. Create a project in the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en).
2. Set the Bearer Token in the config.py file.
3. Set the [User ID](https://www.codeofaninja.com/tools/find-twitter-id/) in the config.py file.
4. Run the run.py script.
